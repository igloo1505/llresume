\tagline{
    Thank you for taking the time to review this. I've been working with common web technologies like javascript \& typescript, css, and Node.js since 2014, including most modern tools like Next.js, Ionic, React Native and more. I also have several years of experience with Python, and have a fair amount of experience with lua and bash/zsh as well. In the early weeks of 2022 I had a realization that occurred to me while reviewing some of Einstein's earliest work related to an assumption that he made, and how that assumption relates to physical phenomena that we've since observed. Almost immediately I began accepting less work until I gave up paid software work entirely to focus on publishing a paper in my formal field of study at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, physics. Now 2 years later, I'm beyond excited to return to full-time work.

            {Aspiring Astrophysicist}
            [While working as a freelance developer I spent much of my time between clients reading the latest cosmology research and daydreaming about the the nature of the Universe. 
            In January of 2022 I was doing exactly this when an assumption that was made in some of Einstein's earliest work occurred to me. While this assumption appears to be common sense at first glance, in the context of cosmic inflation these assumptions appear to have been made in error. I finished my last few small projects and spent the next 2 years working on a testable hypothesis to differentiate the modified geometry I proposed from current interpretations of relativity. That paper is now set to be submitted for publication in July of 2024.]
